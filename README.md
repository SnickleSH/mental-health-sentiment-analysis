A machine learning project designed to analyze and predict mental health conditions based on sentiment analysis of textual data.

**Dataset**: [Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health/data)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The **Mental Health Sentiment Analysis** project aims to develop models that classify mental health conditions using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset includes statements labeled with different mental health statuses, such as depression, anxiety, stress, and suicidal tendencies. The insights derived from this project can support mental health research, sentiment analysis, and chatbot development.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Details

The dataset is a carefully curated collection of mental health statements labeled with different mental health statuses. The raw data has been cleaned and structured, making it a valuable resource for NLP-based mental health analysis.

### **Data Sources**
The dataset integrates information from multiple Kaggle datasets, including:

- 3k Conversations Dataset for Chatbot  
- Depression Reddit Cleaned  
- Human Stress Prediction  
- Predicting Anxiety in Mental Health Data  
- Mental Health Dataset Bipolar  
- Reddit Mental Health Data  
- Students Anxiety and Depression Dataset  
- Suicidal Mental Health Dataset  
- Suicidal Tweet Detection Dataset  

### **Data Structure**
Each entry in the dataset contains:

- `unique_id` - Unique identifier for each statement  
- `Statement` - The text expressing a mental health condition  
- `Mental Health Status` - One of the following labels:  
  - Normal  
  - Depression  
  - Suicidal  
  - Anxiety  
  - Stress  
  - Bi-Polar  
  - Personality Disorder
